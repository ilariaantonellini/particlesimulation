### Introduction 

[Particle Simulation](#particlesimulation) is a project which [I developed](https://github.com/ilariaantonellini/) during 2022-2023 module 3 of the course [Laboratorio di elettromagnetismo e ottica](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2022/434322/).

### Software for the analysis of particles
[Particle Simulation](#particlesimulation) is a software which can categorize and analyze particles.
It is written in [C++](https://isocpp.org/).
This software can be compiled with [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/). It is also supprted on [ROOT](https://root.cern/).
